                                        The amount of time it takes to become PRINCE2® certified can be different for each person.
                                        Getting a foundation certification usually requires a few days of training and studying
                                        than the practitioner. After completing the Foundation level, practitioners will need to
                                        spend more time studying. How long it takes you to finish something, can depend on a few things.
